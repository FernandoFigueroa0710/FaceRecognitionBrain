## What have I learned in this project:

- Login, Logout & Register architecture using React
- The use of [React-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilt) to add movement to component
- The use of [React-Particles](https://rpj.bembi.org/) to add style to the entire application
- The use of [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) as a CSS toolbox
